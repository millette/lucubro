# About this project

Don't you think it's time, after 35 years of computer programming, that I write a journal detailing my projects? I do too and here we are, finally! If you check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/millette), you'll notice over 350 repositories. That's only _recent_ (since 2008) history. I fondly remember my first web game back in 1997 but that's another story. 10 years before that was my first paid gig (I was 16) but that story too will have to wait.

More details about [Lucubro](first-post-lucubro) (this project) are available.
