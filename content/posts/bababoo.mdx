Don't you think it's time, after 35 years of computer programming, that I write a journal? I do too and here we are, finally! If you check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/millette), you'll notice I have over 350 repositories. That's only recent (since 2008) history. I fondly remember my first web game back in 1997 but that's another story. 10 years before that, I was about 16 when I got my first paid gig but that story too will have to wait.

Here's a bit of [code](/about).

```js
"use strict"

const code = {
  bob: 42,
}
```
